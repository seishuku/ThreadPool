# ThreadPool
Never tried making a worker thread pool before...

Just a quick weekend project, I didn't have
any multithread support in any of my projects,
so I figured it's time to do something about that.

Feels fairly complete, probably should have a
way of tracking if a job has completed, but that
can be done by external code means as well.
